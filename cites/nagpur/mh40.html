It was initially built in the year 1870, under Bhonsle rule, for supplying water to the city. Just beside the Ambazari Lake, one can find the Ambazari Garden, which is particularly popular amongst the children and doubles up as an amusement park for them. The garden also has pavements walking, a fountain, electric rides and various amusement games for the kid. In fact, the lake derives its name Ambazari, because of this very fact that it is surrounded by mango trees. (The word Amba means mango in Marathi.) The Nag River also originates from here, and the site is indeed a marvel to look at!
