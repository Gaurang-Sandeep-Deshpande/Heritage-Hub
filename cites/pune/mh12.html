                <div class="city-description"> Shaniwarwada, once the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a
                    286-year-old mansion and is one of the finest examples of architecture in the city. It is now one of
                    the most popular tourist destinations in Maharashtra. This grand mansion was built by the Peshwa
                    Bajirao I himself as the residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently covers an area of 625
                    acres, in its heyday it covered almost the entire area of the city itself. The place never fails to
                    amaze the visitor with its various forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I that
                    greets the visitor at the entrance of the palace. Although most of the Wada was destroyed by an
                    unexplained fire in 1828, what remains of it is equally thrilling and majestic.

                    Mountains. In fact, the fort is strategically built right in the centre of the line of Maratha forts
                    built in the Sahyadris. Some of these citadels are the Rajgad Fort, Torna Fort and the Purandar

                <div class="city-description"> Shivneri Fort is the birthplace of the founder of the Maratha Empire,
                    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. It was built in the 16th century and was recognised as a military
                    fortification. The place is also famous for being the place where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was
                    trained. Its proximity from Pune, atop a hill with Junnar at its base, makes Shivneri Fort a good
                    picnic spot for the locals. Its sheer magnificence draws a considerable number of visitors each
                    year. Plus, there are some more attractions nearby which can be covered along with the fort in a
                    day.

                    Those who are always looking for a quiet and quick escape into nature can head to Shivneri. Its
                    terrain makes it a good trekking route too. Having said that, several history lovers are also drawn
                    to the attraction for its historical significance. An English Traveller, Fraze, who visited Shivneri
                    Fort in the late 17th century noticed that the fort was so well managed that it has enough supplies
                    to feed thousands of families for about 6 to 7 years. The ancient architecture and its massive built
                    is also worth a visit to Shivneri Fort.

                    enshrined by Lord Pataleshwar- the God of the Underworld, who is a form of Lord Shiva. Carved out of
                    a single magnanimous rock, this spellbinding monolithic find is located right in the heart of the
                    city and is a revered Hindu shrine which is thronged by hundreds of devotees and pilgrims on an
                    everyday basis. What is more, the temple has an exuberant architecture with elaborate carvings on
                    the walls and miniature paintings. Other than Lord Shiva, the temple is also dedicated to Nandi and
                    has idols of other Hindu gods and goddesses as well including Lord Ram, Sita, Lakshmi, Lakshman,
                    Ganesh etc. The construction of the temple was inspired by the majestic Elephanta Caves but it was
                    left incomplete. For the same reason, the temple has no real entrance; the only major entrance iis
                    next to a banyan tree in the courtyard. The temple is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of
                    India (ASI).
