                <div class="city-name"> Shanivar Wada</div>
                <div class="city-description">  Shaniwarwada, once the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a 286-year-old mansion and is one of the finest examples of architecture in the city. It is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in Maharashtra. This grand mansion was built by the Peshwa Bajirao I himself as the residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently covers an area of 625 acres, in its heyday it covered almost the entire area of the city itself. The place never fails to amaze the visitor with its various forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I that greets the visitor at the entrance of the palace. Although most of the Wada was destroyed by an unexplained fire in 1828, what remains of it is equally thrilling and majestic.

                    The Shaniwar Wada, although ridden with tales of treachery and deceit, is one of the last standing testimonies to the grandeur, valour, and the just rule of the Peshwas. The entire old part of the city of Pune is laid out in a chaotic yet ironically, orderly fashion all around this historical structure. It is around Shaniwar Wada that you will find the oldest markets of Pune including Laxmi Road, Tulshibaug, Ravivar Peth etc. It is said that on a full moon night the fort is haunted by the ghost of a former Peshwa king Narayanrao as he was murdered in the palace by his aunt and uncle - Anandi and Raghunathrao. However, there is not a shred of evidence to support such claims. So, you can get a glimpse of history and some drama as well! This was after all the site of the famed romance between Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani Sahiba. In fact, one of the gates has also been named after her!

        <div class="city-description">  Situated on the Jangli Maharaj Road in Pune, Pataleshwar Cave Temple is enshrined by Lord Pataleshwar- the God of the Underworld, who is a form of Lord Shiva. Carved out of a single magnanimous rock, this spellbinding monolithic find is located right in the heart of the city and is a revered Hindu shrine which is thronged by hundreds of devotees and pilgrims on an everyday basis. What is more, the temple has an exuberant architecture with elaborate carvings on the walls and miniature paintings. Other than Lord Shiva, the temple is also dedicated to Nandi and has idols of other Hindu gods and goddesses as well including Lord Ram, Sita, Lakshmi, Lakshman, Ganesh etc. The construction of the temple was inspired by the majestic Elephanta Caves but it was left incomplete. For the same reason, the temple has no real entrance; the only major entrance iis next to a banyan tree in the courtyard. The temple is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

        <div class="city-description">   Lal Mahal located near Shaniwar Wada in Pune is a historic landmark of the 16th century. Subject to innumerable attacks and initial revival, the palace has significant stories to tell. It was first restored by Shivaji Maharaj's father Shahaji Bhosle for his family to stay in the 1630s. From being a childhood home for Chhatrapati Shivaji to taking Shaistekhan head-on, this red coloured structure is an architectural marvel depicting craftsmanship and culture of that time.

            With a glorious past, The Lal Mahal highlights the valour of the rulers and leaders of that time. It elucidates the lives and heroic acts of the Maratha Kings - something that the Peshwas were known for. There is nothing much that this place exhibits or explains because of continuous harm to the building. Consequently, it leaves much to imagination like how big it was, how many rooms etc. However, things like a Peshwa on guard - protecting the Mahal and a Maratha soldier surmounting a horse take you back in time.

            Khadakwasla Dam is a famous tourist attraction and a significant work of engineering in Pune. It is built on River Mutha which flows through the city and aids water supply to Pune and its suburban regions. The dam forms a reservoir, called Khadakwasla Lake which offers a quick and pleasant getaway too. Its proximity to Pune City and the scenic surroundings make Khadakwasla Dam a preferred picnic spot. The roadways around Khadakwasla Dam is also a favourite cycling route amongst the city cyclists. Monsoons, in particular, draw a considerable number of people to the attraction. They mostly visit to see the transformation of the landscapes and also enjoy the scenic beauty.

Khadakwasla Dam extends about 1.6 kilometres over River Mutha which actually begins at the confluence of two other rivers, River Ambi and River Mose. These two rivers have Panshet Dam and Varasgaon Dam built over them respectively. They control the water flowing into Mutha from Ambi and Mose. Further, the outflow from the Temghar Dam also entres Khadakwasla Lake. The reservoir thus occupies about 22,000 square kilometres area and runs over 35 metres deep. The dam stands a little over 31 metres tall and is built over the hard rock in the Mutha riverbed. This work of engineering often draws students and enthusiasts too. Otherwise, most people visit to explore the surroundings and other attractions around.
