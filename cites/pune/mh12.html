                    Shaniwar Wada, Pune Overview
                    Shaniwarwada, once the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a 286-year-old mansion and is one of the finest examples of architecture in the city. It is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in Maharashtra. This grand mansion was built by the Peshwa Bajirao I himself as the residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently covers an area of 625 acres, in its heyday it covered almost the entire area of the city itself. The place never fails to amaze the visitor with its various forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I that greets the visitor at the entrance of the palace. Although most of the Wada was destroyed by an unexplained fire in 1828, what remains of it is equally thrilling and majestic.

                        Lal Mahal located near Shaniwar Wada in Pune is a historic landmark of the 16th century. Subject to innumerable attacks and initial revival, the palace has significant stories to tell. It was first restored by Shivaji Maharaj's father Shahaji Bhosle for his family to stay in the 1630s. From being a childhood home for Chhatrapati Shivaji to taking Shaistekhan head-on, this red coloured structure is an architectural marvel depicting craftsmanship and culture of that time.

            Pataleshwar cave temple, Pune Overview
            Situated on the Jangli Maharaj Road in Pune, Pataleshwar Cave Temple is enshrined by Lord Pataleshwar- the God of the Underworld, who is a form of Lord Shiva. Carved out of a single magnanimous rock, this spellbinding monolithic find is located right in the heart of the city and is a revered Hindu shrine which is thronged by hundreds of devotees and pilgrims on an everyday basis. What is more, the temple has an exuberant architecture with elaborate carvings on the walls and miniature paintings. Other than Lord Shiva, the temple is also dedicated to Nandi and has idols of other Hindu gods and goddesses as well including Lord Ram, Sita, Lakshmi, Lakshman, Ganesh etc. The construction of the temple was inspired by the majestic Elephanta Caves but it was left incomplete. For the same reason, the temple has no real entrance; the only major entrance iis next to a banyan tree in the courtyard. The temple is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
            Pataleshwar Temple is dedicated to and named after Lord Pataleshwar which is another name for Lord Shiva. The word ‘Pataleshwar’ translates to Lord of the Underworld i.e. ‘Patal’ meaning ‘Underworld’ and ‘Ishwar’ meaning ‘Lord’. The temple is also known by the names of Panchaleshwar or Bhamburde. It is also believed in the mythologies that the temple was built in just a few hours by the Pandavas when they were exiled and needed shelter.

            Vetal Tekdi is one of Pune's most well-known landmarks. It envelops the entire city and is a stunning place to spend an evening or an early morning. It is known by various names such as Hanuman Tekdi, MIT Tekdi, and Pashan Tekdi.
            The hill can be reached on foot by climbing from the Kothrud side of it near the famous MIT college. One can also attempt the climb from the Pashan side or the Chatushrungi Temple side.
            Although the hill is open throughout the year and at all times of the day, it would be well advised to avoid it post dark for safety. The best time to visit this natural attraction is during the early hours of the morning when the air is crisp and melodious with the sounds of a wide variety of birds. The evening sees a beautiful air of calm descend upon the hill and one can see a glorious sunset. On clear days, thanks to its elevation and sheer scale, one can almost see the entire city of Pune glittering down below.
