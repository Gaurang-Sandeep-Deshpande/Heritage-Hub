                Marine Drive is the most easily identifiable landmark associated with Mumbai and is indicative of
                the glamor and glitter of the city. It is essentially 3.6 km long, arc-shaped boulevard along the
                South Mumbai coast that starts at the southern end of Nariman Point and ends at Girgaum Chowpatty,
                popularly known as Chowpatty Beach. The coast wraps the Arabian sea and is the best place in Mumbai
                to watch the sunset or even to just take a leisurely stroll by the sea any time of the day or night.
                At night, when the whole coastline lights up, it justifies its other moniker i.e. Queen's Necklace.
