                    Panhala Fort, Kolhapur Overview
The Panhala Fort lies 20 km away from the main city of Kolhapur, situated at its north-west. This fort holds its position amongst the most massive location in the country and is the largest one in the Deccan region. It was built in a strategic position where a major trade route ran within Maharashtra from Bijapur to the coasts of Arabian Sea. This place is not only a must-visit for the people who love exploring historic locations but also for those who love to trek.

Looking over the green slopes of Sahyadri, it has around 7 kilometres of fortifications along with full proof protection guaranteed by three double-walled gates which are humongous in size. The entire stretch of Panhala Fort is dotted with parapets, ramparts, and bastions and styled with motifs of different dynasties that ruled over the fort - the Marathas, Bahamas, Mughals and so on. The old Panhala Fort was founded in the late 12th century by Raja Bhoja. It was constructed during the period 1178-1209 AD to be later modified by the Marathas. The Indo-Islamic style fort is famously known for being residences to the great Maratha ruler Shivaji and the Queen Regent of Kolhapur - Tarabai.
